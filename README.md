# 🧠 Kartik Mehta — Personal Research Portfolio

This repository hosts my professional research website — [**kartikmehta.me**](https://kartikmehta.me) — a clean, responsive, and minimalist portfolio built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, deployed via **Netlify**. The site showcases my work in Large Language Models (LLMs), NLP, and Generative AI, featuring my research, publications, and service contributions in a lightweight, fast-loading design optimized for web and mobile.

The website offers a fully responsive interface with smooth scrolling navigation, subtle animations powered by the Intersection Observer API, clean typography, and SEO-friendly metadata. It’s secured with HTTPS (Let’s Encrypt) and configured with `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` to enable search indexing and discoverability. The design emphasizes readability, performance, and professional presentation—ideal for research portfolios and AI professionals.
